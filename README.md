# Week 10: Your Github Profile

## Http Request, React Side Effects, and Client Routing

## Introduction

- For this project, you'll be building a simple Github Profile using React and calling the open Github API.
- You will need to know how to use `axios` and `useEffect` hook together to render data on React state using `useState` hook.

## Instructions

### Task 1: Project Setup


- [ ]  Create a forked copy of this project.
- [ ]  Clone your OWN version of the repository in your terminal
- [ ]  CD into the project base directory `cd Week10_Your_Github_Profile`
- [ ]  Download project dependencies by running `npm install`
- [ ]  Start up the app using `npm start`
- [ ]  Create a new branch: git checkout -b `<firstName-lastName>`. Implement the project on your newly created `<firstName-lastName>` branch, committing changes regularly.
- [ ]  Push commits: git push origin `<firstName-lastName>`.

### Task 2a: MVP

- [ ]  Use Github's open API `https://api.github.com/users/<your-github-username>` to render your profile data. Use the same endpoint and add `/followers` or `/following` at the end to render either your followers or your following. 
- [ ] Make sure your application looks like the [preview image](https://github.com/gabischool/Week10_Your_Github_Profile/blob/main/githubcard.png)
- [ ] Follow all the instructions carefully.



### Task 3: Stretch Goals
